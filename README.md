# Stepik code

This repository contains a generic template, written in Python,
for the backend of Stepik problems.

## Installation

Clone this repository locally. Consider making a copy of the `stepik_backend.py`
file and putting your work in there; this ensures a clean copy of the template
is maintained.

## Contribution

Please feel free to update the template with improvements as necessary.
Avoid committing specific implementations of the backend to this repository
(e.g., a copy of the template filled out with tests and correct answers for
problem *8.1.2* in the course Stepik page); this repository is meant to keep
track of changes to the template, not changes to the backend for individual
problems.
